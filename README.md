# momentum_strategies

This repository contains code and data used for my bachelor's thesis that analyzed momentum strategies on the FTSE 100 from 1996 to 2021. 
The methodology follows the famous paper by Jegadeesh and Titman on momentum strategies. 



Note: This was my first major project in Python and coding in general :)
